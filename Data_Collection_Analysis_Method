just to check that the data is being picked up by the HV system.
wavedump /etc/wavedump/WaveDumpConfig_PCI_9_10_Ch_NS_150.txt

Using xy table (ensure './initxy.sh' and 'source scripts.sh' has been run within XYScripts folder)

To move to specific positions:
moveabsxy XXXX YYYY

To turn off/on motors:
motoroffxy/motoronxy

From within $WM_DAQ:

To collect data for:
- 11.1 mins
./Run_wavedump_PCI_11p1_mins_10_CH_NS_150.sh
Uses this config
 /etc/wavedump/WaveDumpConfig_PCI_CH_10_NS_150.txt

- 3 mins
./Run_wavedump_PCI_3_mins_10_CH_NS_150.sh
Uses same config as above

- 1 min
./Run_wavedump_PCI_1_min_10_CH_NS_150.sh

To move data with correct trigger analysis
./move_10_ch_nom_trig.sh

(Currently, WIP)
To collect the important fitting analysis from the hQ.root files
Go to the run directory of interest ($WM_DATA/.../RUN0000NN) and run 
source XY_move_analyse.sh
Will collate important details in text file.

To then plot data across multiple runs.
(This is for my (John's) data storage system)
path to /XYTesting/
Inside there is a python script called 'datacompile.py'
Takes 3 arguments: starting run, ending run, PMT number
Give it these arguments, it will collect the data across these runs and put them in a folder labelled
PMT162_RUN24-48 or something along these lines in XYTesting.
From there, place Compile_Plot2D.c in said directory and use as described in its preamble.
